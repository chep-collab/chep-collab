# 👋 Hi, I'm Mercy Chepngeno

I'm a **fullstack developer** specializing in frontend-first experiences and robust backend systems. I craft modern interfaces using React, Vue, and Tailwind CSS — and power them with scalable APIs and logic using Node.js, .NET, Express, and Python. Currently diving deep into Data Structures & Algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving edge.
